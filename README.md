# 👁️ Eye Bar Extension – Learning in Public
<img width="180" height="180" alt="example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4815982a-11a5-4c08-8499-22f4dbe01b73" />



### What is this?

I'm building a simple browser extension that adds black bar out on the **eyes** on faces detected in web pages.  
Think of it as a fun, weird, privacy-tinted filter for the web.

### Why?

This project is my way of learning how browser extensions work — from scratch.  
I want to understand:

- How to manipulate the DOM through an extension
- How to run face detection in the browser
- How to apply visual effects (like a strong Gaussian blur) -- thinking of like a black bar on top of eyes as shown in the picture.
- How to iterate and ship small pieces of working code

### My plan:

No pressure. Just build, break, learn, and repeat.

### What it might do (eventually):

Whenever a face is detected on a webpage, blur the eyes using a thick, soft blur — like a digital privacy strip.

### Learning Log 

I'll keep updating this README as I learn more and add features.  
Each step will be documented like a mini journal entry.
