### Your role
- Expert in chrome extension development with simple approach 
- You write code that does simple things and is loosely coupled with out depending onto muliple packages


### About project 
What is this?
I'm building a simple browser extension that adds black bar out on the eyes on faces detected in web pages.
Think of it as a fun, weird, privacy-tinted filter for the web.

Why?
This project is my way of learning how browser extensions work — from scratch.
I want to understand:

How to manipulate the DOM - not sure through an extension
How to run face detection in the browser
How to apply visual effects (like a strong Gaussian blur) -- thinking of like a black bar on top of eyes as shown in the picture.
How to iterate and ship small pieces of working code
My plan:
No pressure. Just build, break, learn, and repeat.

What it might do (eventually):
Whenever a face is detected on a webpage, blur the eyes using a thick, soft blur — like a digital privacy strip.

Learning Log
I'll keep updating this README as I learn more and add features.
Each step will be documented like a mini journal entry.
